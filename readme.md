# bart_rep_design_OSF

This repository contains the data, analysis scripts and figures for the preregistration and later the studies 1 and 2 of the project "Representative Design in Psychological Assessment: A Case Study Using the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART)." 

*data* currently contains two subfolders, *experiment*, containing a file with the sequences of explosion points used in study 1, and *reanalyses* containing the datafiles used for the reanalyses of the studies by Frey et al. (2017), Sch√ºrmann, Frey, and Pleskac (2018), and Steiner and Frey (2019). The data files of the former two can also be accessed with all other data of these studies via https://osf.io/rce7g/, and https://osf.io/bq3ym/, respectively.

*r* contains the R scripts used to run the analyses and for generating the plots. *bart_distributions_plot.R* creates figure *plots/bart_architecture.pdf* (that is, Figure 1 in the Preregistration). *create_bart_distributions.R* creates the sequences of explosion points stored at *data/experiment/bart_distributions.RDS*. *helper.R* contains the functions for the fitting procedure used in the reanalyses reported in the Preregistration. Finally, *reanalyses.R* runs the reanalyses and creates Figure 2 of the Preregistration (*plots/reanalyses.pdf*).

*plots* contains the figures generated by the R scripts.
